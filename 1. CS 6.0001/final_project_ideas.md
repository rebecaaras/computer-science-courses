### Final Project Ideas 

Here are ideas of final projects that I might do on completion of the OSSU Computer Science course.

### My standards

I would really enjoy producing an organized document to publish my project somehow. I always think of Grigori Perelman, the guy who solved the Poincar√© conjecture problem.

He released an article on this topic on his own on a website called [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/). It would be awesome for me do sink myself in some nice and interesting project and being able to share it with others.

#### Something related to **cryptography**. 

Look for a book and search for interesting problems on the field.
