### Final Project Ideas 

Here are ideas of final projects that I might do on completion of the OSSU Computer Science course.

### Project practical details
It took me 300 hours to make my TCC. Obviously it could have been finished in a year but it took me around two. 

The project itself was made in six months, but it took me a long time to decide a topic and start to work hard on it. Also because it was a modeling problem I had a few backs and forths trying to find appropriate experimental data to compare with my theoretical results.

### My standards

I would really enjoy producing an organized document to publish my project somehow. I always think of Grigori Perelman, the guy who solved the Poincar√© conjecture problem.

He released an article on this topic on his own on a website called [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/). It would be awesome for me do sink myself in some nice and interesting project and being able to share it with others.

#### 1. Something related to **cryptography**. 

Look for a book and search for interesting problems on the field.

#### 2. Something related to **AI, Graph theory**...

#### 3. **Relativity**...
Maybe an educational resource website.
Some kind of software to apply relativity calculations and show comparissons and conclusions.

#### 4. Unsolved challenges
There are a few challenge problems over the internet in many fields. I could find one and try to figure a solution. Even if I couldn't solve the problem itself I could still publish my conclusions after working on it with dedication.

Some suggestions of problems:

- cryptography unsolved problems
- one of the millenium problems
